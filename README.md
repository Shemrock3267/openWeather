# Local deployment
- Copy repo or files to your local machine into a separate folder (name it whatever is better for you).
- Navigate to that particular folder (it should contain all of the files from a repo).
- Open it with your preffered IDE. I would recommend using VS Code with LiveServer extension installed.
- At the right bottom of it you can press "Go Live" and it will start an application using your default browser at localhost:5500

# Known issues
Because this service is free of charge, approximately 1000 queries per day, it has an outdated API which uses http protocol to serve data. For this reason you'll probably won't be able to deploy it and make it work.
As for now the best possible solution is to use it on a local machine.
