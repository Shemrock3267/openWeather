# Local deployment
- Copy repo or files to your local machine into a separate folder (name it whatever is better for you).
- Navigate to that particular folder (it should contain all of the files from a repo).
- Open it with your preffered IDE. I would recommend using VS Code with LiveServer extension installed.
- At the right bottom of it you can press "Go Live" and it will start an application using your default browser at localhost:5500
